    <title>How Erdpyramiden are made</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    When dry, a type of clay called moraine clay is as hard as stone;
    dampened it forms a porridge-like substance which begins to slip and
    flow downhill. In this way, over a period of time, the saturated
    moraine clay slides down into the stream below and is washed away.
    This constant and continuous slippage is temporarily halted only
    when this erosion encounters a forest where the underlying ground is
    so dry that it is rock hard, which hinders further rapid slippage.
    This is how steep cliffs, up to 10 to 15 meters in height and a
    pre-condition for the formation of the earth pyramids, are made.
    Wherever the moraine contains larger stones which keep the earth
    underneath dry and hard, earth pyramids are formed by literally
    being "washed", or more precisely eroded, out of these cliffs. The
    higher the cliff and the higher up a suitable stone is found, the
    taller and mightier the resulting pyramid becomes.<br>
