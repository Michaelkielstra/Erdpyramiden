Continue on Trail No. 35 until Trail No. 28 branches off towards Kematen (1,322 m; 1 hour from Soprabolzano; food and drink available; closed Mondays). Be sure to stop by to see the Gothic chapel in Kematen. From Kematen, follow Trail No. 29 to the Maria Saal pilgrimage church (1,174 m). The sanctuary has a fresco worth seeing entitled Madonna with an Umbrella. Food and drinks are available at the inn next door (closed Fridays) or 5 minutes further, at the Gasthaus Egarter inn (closed Mondays); about 1 hour from Kematen. For the return, take the path to the earth pyramids, Trail No. 24, to Collalbo/Klobenstein (1 hour). From Collalbo, return to Renon using the narrow-gauge railway o Sobrabolzano, or walk on Trail No. 35, which takes about 80 minutes.";

For the way back you follow the marking no. 2 to Steinegg. Altogether the well signposted pyramid round is circa 4.5 kilometers long and takes about three hours.";
